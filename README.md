# bootstrap-ui-project
This project was built with Bootstrap 5 to design responsive and modern web pages. It includes Home, About, and Contact pages featuring Navbar, Carousel, Cards, Form, and Modal. Developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, Git, and GitHub Pages for hosting. The task improved my skills in responsive design, UI/UX, and deployment workflows.
